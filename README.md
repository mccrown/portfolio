# Conner McCown Portfolio Page

## Description

My about me section has Lorem HTML until I have a more complete paragraph about myself. It also has a recent photo of me.

My projects section is currently housing one complete project, Run Buddy, with more projects to be added as I complete them. Robot Gladiators is a JS game that will be added next.

Currently, the only clickable links that do not redirect anywhere is the Resume link (still finalizing this), as well as the Robot Gladiators and Coming soon projects.

I plan on polishing this page as the course goes on, but I believe all the criteria for this assignment has been met.
